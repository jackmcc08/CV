Hi! My name is Jack McCarthy and I am currently multiclassing as a programmer. After 8 years in the energy industry as a procurement professional negotiating goods and services contracts, I am now looking to put my time and effort into creating programs which are fun and and easy to use (especially after having to use industry standard procurement programs!). 

I am a logical and organised thinker who is experienced at managing projects and working under pressure. The skills I have gained to date have been very useful in learning how to program. For example, through my experience drafting contracts I am used to analysing specifications and ensuring the contract is written to meet them, is logically consistent (essentially I was writing programs for companies to interact with each other) and looking for contract loopholes to close (debugging!).  

My programming journey started in 2020 with freecodecamp and codecademy courses, before deciding to take the plunge in 2021 when I left my job and signed up to the Makers Bootcamp. My experience at Makers Academy has been .... and I am really looking forward to working in the tech industry to become a full-fledged junior softwware engineer and continue my programming journey. Please check out some of my work below.
