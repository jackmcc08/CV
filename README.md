Hi! My name is Jack McCarthy and I am currently multiclassing as a programmer. After 8 years in the energy industry as a procurement professional, negotiating goods and services contracts, I am now looking to put my time and effort into creating programs which are fun and and easy to use (especially after having to use several of the industry standard procurement programs!).

My programming journey started in 2020 with freecodecamp and codecademy courses, before deciding to take the plunge in early 2021 when I left my job and signed up to the Makers Coding Bootcamp. Please check out some of my work below.
