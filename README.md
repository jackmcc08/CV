Hi! My name is Jack McCarthy and I am currently multiclassing as a programmer. I am a logical and organised thinker who is experienced at managing projects, a great team player and good at working under pressure. After 8 years in the energy industry as a procurement professional negotiating goods and services contracts, I am now looking to put my time and effort into creating programs which are fun and and easy to use (especially after having to use industry standard procurement programs!). 

My programming journey started in 2020 with freecodecamp and codecademy courses, before deciding to take the plunge in 2021 when I left my job and signed up to the Makers Academy Bootcamp. My experience at the Academy has been a fantastic and intense experience where I have built several awesome projects with various different technologies including Ruby-on-Rails and React.js. Four of these have been group projects where we used Agile working practices, delivering fully functioning programs in short timeframes, often while learning new technologies. 

My time at Makers has left me feeling ready to learn any tech stack. I am looking forward to working in the tech industry to become a full-fledged softwware engineer and continue my learning journey. Please check out some of my work below.

## Skills

#### Teamwork 

Significant experience leading and participating in cross-functional teams. I am very action-orientated and look to drive work to completion, as well as providing a fun environment to work in. At Makers, I have leveraged my team working skills in four separate group projects, often helping to set the initial ground work and get the ball rolling.
Key Achievements:
- Worked with a team of eight at Makers to develop a facebook clone in two weeks, I helped drive the team to set an initial MVP and get it completed in the first few days.
- Part of an internal consultancy project, working with BP staff across the globe (from Australia to Chicago). We worked completely remotely, managing multiple time zones. We completed the project on time and presented to the group head of finance.
- Led a negotiation team that worked over a short time frame (one week) to agree key negotiation priorities, got senior level agreement and then succesfully negotiated with a national contractor and provided the leverage to maintain our key licences.


#### Communication and Presentation
Experienced communicator and presenter, ranging from writing reports for and agreeing requirements with senior stakeholders, negotiating with third parties, to coaching and mentoring junior members of staff. In my time at Makers, used this skill to clearly communicate technical requirements, understand how certain sections of code worked and for presenting our group projects. 
Key Achievements:
- Wrote rig market reports that were well received by company executives, who used the report data to make key fleet decisions.
- Persuaded a senior stakeholder to preserve out contracting options in order to allow us flexibility in our procurement process, rather than closing down the options too soon.
  

#### Project Management and Leadership

Multiple years of leading and managing end to end procurement projects. Projects typically involved developing contracts to meet business requirements, ensuring stakeholders requirements were met and managing their expectations along with constant communication. Consistently worked to deadlines and secured contracts to meet budgets. Also involved heavy interaction and negotiation with external parties. 
Key Achievements:
- Secured a rig contract while under US Iran Sanctions
- Led team which developed the procurement strategy for a multi-billion dollar LNG project in West Africa. 
- Managed project to secure new rig types for Azerbaijan.

#### Quick Study

Able to learn new technologies and practices quickly. During my time at BP I was often asked to support projects at short notice, and was able to pick up key issues and develop solutions quickly. At Makers, I took on two projects where I had to learn new technologies for each project and deliver a working product in a short time frame.
Key Achievements: 
  - Delivered a react.js frontend application for final Makers Group project, had to learn and start using react in a week.
  - Developed a contract strategy for a multi-billion dollar LNG project in West Africa, within one month of taking on the role, for procurement categories I did not have prior experience in.

#### Analysis and Problem Solving

Able to quickly review and analyse material including contracts, market data, and reports to understand what is going on and produce plans and suggestions on the way to progress. In my time at Makers I have used this skill to develop a good debugging methodology, utlising the debugging loop (get visibility, tighten the loop, fix the one issue, repeat), which has helped me solve key problems in our group projects. 
Key Achievements:
- Debugged a production bug in our hosted API for our final group project, allowing us to fully implement JWT authentication tokens.
- Produced market intelligence and strategy reports on the Drilling Rigs market for C-level executives. 
- Developed fleet management strategies for stranded assets, mitigating significant losses.

#### Agile

Over the past 2 years have been working in an agile working environment, working in project development scrums and using kanban boards. Also leveraged Agile working skills during Makers group projects. 
Key Achievements:
- Produced an MVP of a facebook clone in the first three days of the project, we agreed key features at the beginning and then held daily standups to ensure we were on track. We used a Trello board to track our progress. 
- Set up a kanban board for the rigs procurement team and ran daily stand-ups.
- Worked in the Tortue Phase 2 project optimisation scrum, where I set up a strategic supplier engagment sessions from start to finish in one month compared to a usual timeframe of 3+ months. 

#### Negotiation

Multiple years of leading and supporting negotiations. Key aspects to this skill include ability to quickly synthesize information, contracts and context into a negotiation strategy, in-depth scenario planning and ability to say no in negotiations while under pressure. 
Key Achievements:
- Negotiated Coronavirus impact claims, landing changes to contracts at no additional cost to the company.
- Negotiated Termination claims, securing a settlement at 15% of original claim value.
- Led complex negotiation with state-owned drilling contractor navigating challenging government and competitive pressures. 

#### Other Key Skills - Contract Reviewing and Drafting, Strategic Sourcing, Coaching & Mentoring, Remote Working, Working with Global Teams.
